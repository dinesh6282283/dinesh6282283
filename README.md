# 👋 Hey there, I'm **Dinesh R**  
### 🚀 Full-Stack Developer | 🧠 AI & Deep Learning Enthusiast  

I'm a developer who loves **building things from scratch** — from browser extensions to full-stack web apps and deep learning models.  
I have a real *fire in the belly* for learning and enjoy exploring how every layer — frontend, backend, and data — connects to make great systems.
