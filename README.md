# Hi — I’m Dinesh R 👋  
**Full-Stack Developer • AI / Deep Learning Enthusiast**

I build practical web applications and end-to-end ML systems. I enjoy starting projects from scratch so I can understand how every layer — frontend, backend, and data — works together. I have a hunger to learn (a real *fire in the belly*) and I bring that curiosity into every codebase I touch.

---

## 🔭 What I do
- Build full-stack web apps using **Node.js**, **React**, and vanilla JavaScript.  
- Design and train CNNs for image classification tasks using **TensorFlow / Keras** and **OpenCV**.  
- Deploy apps and static sites on **Render** and **Netlify**; maintain code with **Git/GitHub**.  
- Focus on writing maintainable code, clear APIs, and production-aware workflows.
